SPOILER WARNING (there's a guide in the actual game by typing "Help" outside of battle) and if the game's ever too difficult, type "easy" outside of battle. The effects should be self explanitory

This was created as a javascript project during my first year at college and was pretty fun to make. The characters used in this was going to be included in a series of other games...but I never got around to making them. Almost all of the code wasn't touched from when I submitted it, so you might encounter a couple glitches. There were only two actual changes.

Changes:
- Poison incorrectly showing up on menu was fixed
  - When you have poison and you open up your menu outside of battle, you'll noticed a message next to your HP that displays whether or not you're poisoned. Unfortunately I messed up the code so the message will only show up when you don't have poison
- Ending
  - When you make it to the ending with one of your partners, there's now a link that displays something...special depending on the character, you'll have to beat the game yourself if you want to see them

Easy Mode Differences
- Level ups are doubled making the game way too easy
- The location of the boss on the map is displayed
- There's no real ending, only text encouraging you to try again on normal mode

Partners:
- The only difference between the four routes is the partner that tags along with you. I originally wanted different enemies, bosses, and room descriptions, but I kinda got lazy. The game does give you descriptions for their character and abilities by typing "help" outside of battle, but here's a more descriptive guide on them
- Lance
  - The top route leads to Lance
  - He's slightly stronger than you
  - He sometimes waste turns
- Peggy
  - The bottom right route leads to Peggy
  - She's weaker than you
  - She sometimes waste turns
  - She can heal you (being the only way to heal other than using a potion)
- Ria
  - The bottom route leads to Ria joining your party
  - She's the strongest ally but also the most inaccurate. Her hit rate is x/3, with x being the number of enemies, so if there's 3 enemies, her hit rate is 100%, but if there's only one, her hit rate is 33%
  - She can raise your defense or attack for one turn
- (No one)
  - The top right route leads to no ally joining you, leaving you by yourself

(Known) Glitches:
- Lance's turn wasting move of wiping sweat doesn't display any text (this might apply to others as well, but I haven't tested this)
- When Fish Soldier attacks, sometimes its name isn't displayed
- Around the end, some of the enemies' stats are low compared to the player's high defense and HP, causing them to sometimes deal no damage to the player or at most 2 to their 50+ HP. This was done as I wanted the game to be beatable even when easy mode isn't on to ensure they never get stuck because the later enemies kept OHKOing them
- In the final boss, if you kill any of the other bosses that are spawned, the battle immediately ends as all bosses are programmed to immediately end the battle when they're defeated

Secrets:
- Different Partners
  - If you name yourself "Lance"and try to recruit him, the character that joins in is different. This is only an aesthetic difference as despite having different dialogue, they function the same as the partner they're a copy of. This similarily applies to naming yourself "Peggy" and "Ria".
- Alternate Ending
  - If you make it to the end all on your own, you can walk all the way back to the entrance for an alternate ending that...makes no sense
  
Inspirations:
- Doll
  - The first boss fight in Mother/Earthbound Beginnings was against your sister's possessed doll. I thought I'd reference this boss as my game's encounter mechanic basically ripped off the one used in Mother/Earthbound Beginnings'. The attack and HP stat for the enemy is identical to the one in Mother/Earthbound Beginnings, with the exception being the defense (due to the stats for my game working differently)
- Spider Queen
  - On the morning this project was due, I was browing YouTube and a video for the game "Spider's Web" (developed by Teamsin3) showed up in my recommended. I was going to watch it right away but I realized that I had to finish programming this game by the end of the day. For whatever reason, the video couldn't popping in my head and at the same time I was struggling to think of more boss ideas (as from the start I planned a total of 7), so I decided to just put a spider queen as a boss and also created a generic spider enemy to go along with it
- Poltergeist of the Mansion
  - Although the idea itself wasn't inspired by anything in particular, the boss speaks IN ALL CAPS was inspired by the way Dialga and Palkia talk in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Time (plus its two other installments), a game I played a lot as a kid, but recently beaten for the first time (I was even listening to the soundtrack of the game while programming)
